This project targets both Windows and Linux. When validating a CMake build on a Windows host, you must verify both platforms.
If the current platform is Windows, create two separate build directories:
    1. `build-msvc`: Run `cmake` configure and `cmake --build` here for the native Windows build, using the default Windows generator (typically a Microsoft Visual Studio generator). Do not use Ninja generator for Windows platform. 
    2. `build-aarch64`: Run `cmake` configure and `cmake --build` here for the Linux aarch64 build. During configuration, include `-DCMAKE_TARGET_ARCH=aarch64`. All commands for this build must be executed via `wsl`.
If the current platform is Linux, only need to work on the `build-aarch64` build directory, and ignore verifying the implementation on Windows platform. 


It is not allowed to include system headers in source files, all system and external headers must be included in VK_common.h, and other source files need to include VK_common.h to include those external headers indirectly. 

For code generation, do not add comments except I ask you to add comments.

This is a benchmark test app, if any Vulkan API returns error, you should throw an std::runtime_error("...") instead of continuing. We should expose error as early as possible in a test app instead of tolerating it.  

It’s pointless to rearrange the deck chairs on a sinking ship. There’s no need to tear down allocated resources before throwing `std::runtime_error`, the program is going to terminate anyway, so do not add those redundant cleanup steps.
